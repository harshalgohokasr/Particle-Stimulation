   p5.js Project Structure
A p5.js project is like any other web projectâ€”it utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A typical p5.js project includes the p5.js library, index.html, style.css, and sketch.js.

Including the p5.js Library
The p5.js library must be included using a <script> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document. Only then, the p5.js library can be used in a JavaScript file.
